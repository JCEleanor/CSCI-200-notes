The Loop & Function Errors starter program, as it currently stands, contains a number of errors related to the learning objectives stated. Your task is to correct the program, describe the type of error(s) you found, and list all the different values you need to input to test all possible cases in each section of the program. You should write this information (errors found/corrected and test values) as a comment at the top of each program section.

Compile and run the program. It is obviously not correct! Your first task is to get the program to build correctly.

Then for each section, you must correct the error or errors. To identify the errors, you may need to do some calculations. For example, if the program says it is calculating the sum of the numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive), the result should be 15.

NOTE #1: The program contains some sections with "infinite" loops. Some infinite loops will cause a message to keep scrolling on your screen. For others nothing will appear (at least immediately) on your screen.

NOTE #2: If you get help on any of these sections, BE SURE that you understand the answer. You may see questions similar to these on the exam.
