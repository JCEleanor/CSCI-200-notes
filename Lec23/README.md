# Templates

```c++
// by convention, name the generic type T. (but you could name it however you want)
template<typename T>
```

## hpp file

it contains implementation and definition

## some tutorials say to do

don't do it like p.21. it will create an empty object file (compiling-wise, it works thou)

## Template classes

note: you shouls implement big three for the code in p.25 (but for simplicity, it's not there)
